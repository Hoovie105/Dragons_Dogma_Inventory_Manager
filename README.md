🧠 Caching Strategy

Uses in-memory caching for armor and weapon data

Optimized for a single-instance deployment

Cache is populated on first request and reused

Cache is cleared automatically on application restart or data updates

This approach keeps responses fast while avoiding unnecessary infrastructure.

---

🖼 Image Handling

Images are not stored in the database

PostgreSQL stores only image paths

Images are served statically from the filesystem or public directory

Improves performance and keeps the database lightweight

---

🐳 Docker Overview

Backend
Python 3.11

FastAPI served via Uvicorn

SQLAlchemy for database access

Frontend
Vite + React build

Optimized production bundle

Docker Compose
Orchestrates frontend, backend, and database

Handles networking between services

Suitable for local development and deployment

---

🌍 Deployment

The project is designed to run as a single instance and can be deployed on:

Render

Linode

Any Docker-compatible VPS

Recommended deployment setup:

One backend instance

Managed PostgreSQL

Static image serving via web server or CDN

---

🔮 Future Improvements
